# Bhashini Model Overview

## Introduction

Bhashini is an Indian government initiative developed under the National Language Translation Mission by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. Launched in August 2022, Bhashini aims to help Indian citizens translate content across various Indian languages, thereby reducing language barriers and enabling effective communication among speakers of different languages across India.

## Purpose & Usefulness

Bhashini's primary objectives include:

- **Digital Inclusion**: Enabling all Indians to access the internet and digital services in their native languages, thereby increasing the content available in Indian languages. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

- **AI-Driven Language Solutions**: Utilizing artificial intelligence and natural language processing to provide real-time translation and other language services, facilitating seamless communication across diverse linguistic groups. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

## ULCA

Universal Language Contribution APIs (ULCA) is an open-sourced scalable data platform, supporting various types of dataset for Indic languages, along with a user interface for interacting with the datasets.
You can read more on ULCA [here](https://github.com/bhashini-dibd/ulca)

## ULCA & Bhashini Link

Now how is Bhashini utilizing ULCA and do we even require Bhashini in such case?
The Universal Language Contribution API (ULCA) is a standard and scalable platform for Indian language datasets and models, acting as the largest repository of Indian languages. Bhashini captures data and model contributions through ULCA, aiding researchers in developing AI technologies such as machine translation, automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and optical character recognition (OCR) across various Indian languages. To put it in simpler terms Bhashini provides a more one stop solution for Indic Language tasks leveraging ULCA.

## Limitations

While Bhashini offers a unified platform for language services, there may be instances where specific APIs or services are not fully accessible or operational. In such cases, alternative methods or platforms may be required for inference.
Coming to personal usage, Bhashini does not provide APIs sooner after registration which could be a hassle.

## Usage & Model Access

The best way to utilize Bhashini is to explore how models interact with each other and then you can visit the independent model/org github page and make use of their inference codes. Using Google Colab would be more than sufficient too!

## Getting Started (Just a small idea - Other ways are highly appreciated)

1. **Explore Models**: Visit the Bhashini's [page](https://bhashini.gov.in/ulca/model/explore-models) to see how models interact in the given task and you can explore models that are responsile for each specified tasks as well.

2. **Inference Setup**: Following models for certain tasks will lead you to the contributor's (eg. AI4Bharat) github page that can be helpful as they would contain instructions to run inference using their models.

3. **Prototype Applications**: Utilize these models to build applications or prototypes, enabling functionalities like speech recognition, translation, or text-to-speech in Indian languages.

## Conclusion

By leveraging platforms like Bhashini and resources from initiatives like AI4Bharat, developers and researchers can contribute to and benefit from the growing ecosystem of AI-driven language solutions, promoting digital inclusivity and accessibility across India's diverse linguistic landscape.
